# Learning PHP

Here you can find some code examples for fixing PHP concepts

In order to run a PHP script called `run-me.php`, you can just type

```
php run-me.php
```

You do not need a robust software like XAMPP or WAMPP for running a server, once 
PHP provides a remote server for doing so. Just go to the script you want to run and type

```
php -S localhost:<port>
```

where `port` is the port you want to run your server
